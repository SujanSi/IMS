<!-- how to commit to repo -->

git commit -m "build: <message>"
Sure, here's a list of the conventional commit types along with their meanings:

1. **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., npm, make, etc.).

2. **ci**: Changes to the Continuous Integration (CI) configuration files and scripts.

3. **docs**: Documentation changes only, such as updating README files or adding comments in code.

4. **feat**: New features or functionalities added to the project.

5. **fix**: Bug fixes, addressing issues or problems in the codebase.

6. **perf**: Changes that improve the performance of the codebase.

7. **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing its external behavior. This includes restructuring code for readability or optimization.

8. **style**: Changes related to code formatting, indentation, or coding style. This does not affect the code's functionality.

9. **test**: Adding new tests or modifying existing ones. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

10. **chore**: Other changes that don't fit into any of the above categories. This can include updating dependencies, configuring tools, or any other miscellaneous tasks.

11. **revert**: Reverting a previous commit.

12. **bump**: Bumping the version number of the project, typically used in semantic versioning.

These conventional commit types help maintain consistency in commit messages and provide useful information about the nature of changes made to the project.
